ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR)

(Capillary photometry)

11

Note

1. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is the recommended test in acute inflammatory conditions.

2. Test conducted on EDTA whole blood at 37°C.

3. ESR readings  are auto- corrected with respect to Hematocrit (PCV) values.

WIDAL TEST, SERUM

(Slide Agglutination)

Salmonella typhi O (TO) Non Reactive

Salmonella typhi H (TH) Non Reactive

Salmonella paratyphi A, H (AH) Non Reactive

Salmonella paratyphi B, H (BH) Non Reactive

Note: 1. Titres 1:80 and above of “O” antigen & 1:160 and above of “H” antigen are significant 

       2. Rising titres are significant

3. The recommended Widal test is by Tube Agglutination Method

Comments

This test measures somatic O and flagellar H antibodies against Typhoid and Paratyphoid bacilli. The 

agglutinins usually appear at the end of the first week of infection and increase steadily till third / fourth 

week after which the decline starts. A positive Widal test may occur because of typhoid vaccination or 

previous typhoid infection and in certain autoimmune diseases. Non specific febrile disease may cause

this titre to increase (anamnestic reaction). The test may be falsely negative in cases of Enteric fever 

treated with antibiotics in the early stages. The recommended test specially in the first week after infection

is Blood Culture.
