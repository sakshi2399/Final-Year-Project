            "engtext_172.wav 165538 as soon as the merchant took the bowl in his hands he knew it was of gold\n",
            "engtext_173.wav 160320 he said all that i have here is not worth so much as this bowl\n",
            "engtext_174.wav 125680 it is a golden bowl i am not rich enough to buy it\n",
            "Too Long: engtext_175.wav\n",
            "engtext_176.wav 67950 it was worth nothing to him\n",

            "engtext_178.wav 77594 but the merchant would not have it so\n",
            "engtext_179.wav 133800 he gave the woman all the money he had and all his wares\n",
            "engtext_180.wav 89890 give me but eight pennies he said\n",
            "engtext_181.wav 79944 so he took the pennies and left\n",
            "engtext_182.wav 200986 going quickly to the river he paid the boatman the eight pennies to take him across the river\n",
            "engtext_183.wav 181330 soon the greedy merchant went back to the house where he had seen the golden bowl\n",
            "engtext_184.wav 144880 he said bring that bowl to me and i will give you something for it\n",
            "engtext_185.wav 278178 no said the grandmother you said the bowl was worthless but another merchant has paid a great price for it and taken it away\n",
            "engtext_186.wav 285784 then the greedy merchant was angry crying out through this other man i have lost a small fortune that bowl was of gold\n",
            "engtext_187.wav 289076 he ran down to the riverside and seeing the other merchant in the boat out in the river he called hello boatman stop your boat\n",
            "engtext_188.wav 102694 but the man in the boat said do not stop\n",
            "engtext_189.wav 225638 so he reached the city on the other side of the river and lived well for a time on the money the bowl brought him\n",

            "engtext_198.wav 235632 oh we will take you if only you can keep your mouth shut and say not a word to anybody they said\n",

            "engtext_201.wav 172576 so the next day the geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it\n",

            "engtext_214.wav 102594 so the man brought his ox into the village\n",

            "engtext_217.wav 83340 then the owner whipped his ox\n",
            "engtext_218.wav 157482 but the ox had never been talked to in that way and he stood still\n",
            "engtext_219.wav 128596 neither the blows nor the hard names could make him move\n",
            "engtext_220.wav 158684 at last the poor man paid his forfeit and went sadly home\n",
            "engtext_221.wav 187204 there he threw himself on his bed and cried why did that strong ox act so\n",
            "engtext_222.wav 121520 many a time he has moved heavier loads easily\n",
            "engtext_223.wav 114442 why did he shame me before all those people\n",
            "engtext_224.wav 112632 at last he got up and went about his work\n",
            "engtext_225.wav 215856 when he went to feed the ox that night the ox turned to him and said why did you whip me today\n",

            "engtext_227.wav 119752 then the man said i will never treat you badly again\n",
            "engtext_228.wav 116332 i am sorry i whipped you and called you bad names\n",
            "engtext_229.wav 173296 i will never do so any more forgive me very well said the ox\n",
            "engtext_230.wav 151746 tomorrow i will go into the village and draw the one hundred carts for you\n",

            "engtext_234.wav 134246 when they went into the village the men laughed at the man again\n",
            "engtext_235.wav 105630 they said did you come back to lose more money\n",
            "engtext_236.wav 298716 today i will pay a fortune of two thousand pieces of silver if my ox is not strong enough to pull the one hundred carts said the owner\n",
            "engtext_237.wav 176096 so again the carts were placed in a line and the ox was yoked to the first\n",

            "engtext_239.wav 170882 the owner said good ox show how strong you are you fine creature\n",
            "engtext_240.wav 111940 and he patted his neck and stroked his sides\n",
            "engtext_241.wav 102922 at once the ox pulled with all his strength\n",

            "engtext_243.wav 279164 then the crowd shouted and they paid back the forfeit the man had lost saying your ox is the strongest ox we ever saw\n",
            "engtext_244.wav 105166 and the ox and the man went home happy\n",
            "engtext_245.wav 193964 once upon a time a merchant with his goods packed in many carts came to a desert\n",

            "engtext_256.wav 92596 they built fires and cooked the rice\n",
            "engtext_257.wav 272256 then they spread a great awning over all the carts and the oxen and the men lay down under it to rest until sunset\n",
            "engtext_258.wav 149796 in the early evening they again built fires and cooked rice\n",

            "engtext_266.wav 79750 yoke the oxen and start on\n",
            "engtext_267.wav 112282 then the pilot took his place at the head of the line\n",
